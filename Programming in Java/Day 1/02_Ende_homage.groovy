// This code has an assignment to a variable i and a loop. The code will enter
// the loop increment i and print that value while i has a value less than 5.
// It assigns the value 10 to the variable i which means it will never enter the
// loop, thus doing nothing.
// To enter the loop the assignment would need to be less than 5.
